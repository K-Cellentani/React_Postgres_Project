# React_Postgres_Project

This React project serves as a user interface for collecting census data and adding it to a PostgreSQL database. Users can input information such as the state, total annual payroll amount, and year, which are then sent to the server for storage. Upon submission, the data is sent via a POST request to the server for database insertion. The project utilizes React hooks like useState for managing form state and fetch API for handling HTTP requests. See the project under the my-app folder.
